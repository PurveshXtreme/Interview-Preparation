Hi, my name is Purvesh Jambhulkar, and I’m currently based in Pune, India. I’m an engineering student specializing in Information Technology at D.Y. Patil College of Engineering, Akurdi. I'm passionate about building scalable web applications and exploring emerging AI technologies.

I’ve worked on several full-stack projects, including event websites, game-based educational platforms, and a React UI component library (zapi-ui) published on npm. I’m proficient with tools like React.js, Next.js, Node.js, and databases like MongoDB and SQL, with strong skills in responsive design, clean component architecture, and API integrations.

I’ve had the opportunity to build Samprabhava 2025, an interactive event website for NIPER Mohali. I also developed a game-based learning platform with dashboards and user tracking. Additionally, I’ve explored AI through Quill.AI, a chatbot that uses LLMs to summarize text 

On the personal side,I enjoy exploring new AI trends, listening to rap music, and working on creative side projects that challenge my thinking. I also actively participate in hackathons and tech workshops, like the Smart India Hackathon and ITESA events, which allow me to collaborate, learn, and grow in team-based environments.

I’m excited about opportunities that allow me to create intuitive user experiences and build meaningful, high-impact applications
