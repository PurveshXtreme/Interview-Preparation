“Thank you for this opportunity. I’m Purvesh Jambhulkar, currently pursuing my Bachelor in Information Technology from D.Y. Patil College of Engineering, Pune. I’m passionate about building scalable web applications and exploring AI technologies.
I’ve worked on several full-stack projects, including Prepify, an AI-powered mock interview platform; LearnPlay, a gamified educational platform; and ZAPI-UI, a reusable React component library published on npm. These projects gave me hands-on experience in full-stack development, API integration, and responsive design.
I’ve also actively participated in hackathons, including the Smart India Hackathon, where I collaborated with teams to solve complex problems under time constraints, enhancing my teamwork and problem-solving skills.
“I enjoy working on creative side projects, collaborating in team-based environments, and constantly upgrading my technical skills.”. I’m excited about opportunities where I can contribute my skills to build meaningful, high-impact applications.”
