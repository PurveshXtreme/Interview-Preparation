## What is Big Data?
Big Data refers to extremely large and complex datasets that cannot be stored, processed, or analyzed using traditional database systems like RDBMS.  
These datasets come from modern sources such as:

- Social media  
- Mobile devices  
- IoT sensors  
- Online transactions  
- System logs  
- Enterprise applications

## The 5 Vs of Big Data

### **1. Volume**
The amount of data generated every second is massive—terabytes, petabytes, or even exabytes.

### **2. Velocity**
The speed at which data is created and needs to be processed (e.g., real-time streams, sensor data).

### **3. Variety**
Data comes in multiple formats:
- Structured (tables)  
- Semi-structured (XML, JSON)  
- Unstructured (videos, images, logs)  

### **4. Veracity**
-Veracity refers to the trustworthiness, accuracy, and quality of the data.
-Data can be noisy, incomplete, or inconsistent. Ensuring accuracy and reliability is a challenge.

### **5. Value**
The most important V — the useful insights or business impact derived from analyzing Big Data.

## Big Data Technologies
Because of the 5Vs, companies use specialized technologies such as:

- **Hadoop** → Distributed storage & batch processing  
- **HDFS** → Distributed file system  
- **Apache Spark** → Fast, in-memory processing engine

These tools allow organizations to store, process, and analyze massive datasets efficiently.
