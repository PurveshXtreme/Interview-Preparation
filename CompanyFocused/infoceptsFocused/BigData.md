## What is Big Data?
Big Data refers to extremely large and complex datasets that cannot be stored, processed, or analyzed using traditional database systems like RDBMS.  
These datasets come from modern sources such as:

- Social media  
- Mobile devices  
- IoT sensors  
- Online transactions  
- System logs  
- Enterprise applications

## The 5 Vs of Big Data

### **1. Volume**
The amount of data generated every second is massive—terabytes, petabytes, or even exabytes.

### **2. Velocity**
The speed at which data is created and needs to be processed (e.g., real-time streams, sensor data).

### **3. Variety**
Data comes in multiple formats:
- Structured (tables)  
- Semi-structured (XML, JSON)  
- Unstructured (videos, images, logs)  

### **4. Veracity**
-Veracity refers to the trustworthiness, accuracy, and quality of the data.
-Data can be noisy, incomplete, or inconsistent. Ensuring accuracy and reliability is a challenge.

### **5. Value**
The most important V — the useful insights or business impact derived from analyzing Big Data.

## Big Data Technologies
Because of the 5Vs, companies use specialized technologies such as:

- **Hadoop** → Distributed storage & batch processing  
- **HDFS** → Distributed file system  
- **Apache Spark** → Fast, in-memory processing engine

These tools allow organizations to store, process, and analyze massive datasets efficiently.

# Big Data Analytics

---

## Definition
**Big Data Analytics** is the process of examining large, complex datasets to uncover:

- Hidden patterns  
- Correlations  
- Trends  
- Customer behavior  
- Business insights  

---

## Types of Analytics
Analytics is generally divided into **four major types**, each answering a different business question.

---

## 1. Descriptive Analytics
### **Question it answers:**  
👉 *“What happened?”*

### **Meaning:**  
Descriptive analytics summarizes **past data** to show trends and patterns.  
It does **not** explain why something happened — only **what** happened.

### **Examples:**  
- Monthly sales reports  
- Website traffic dashboards  
- Number of new users last week  
- Daily revenue charts  

### **Interview phrasing:**  
“It gives insights based on historical data.”

---

## 2. Diagnostic Analytics
### **Question it answers:**  
👉 *“Why did it happen?”*

### **Meaning:**  
Diagnostic analytics digs deeper into descriptive data to find **reasons or causes** behind an event.

### **Techniques used:**  
- Drill-down  
- Data discovery  
- Correlation analysis  

### **Examples:**  
- Sales dropped → because a competitor offered discounts  
- Website traffic reduced → due to server downtime  
- Machine failed → overheating pattern found in logs  

---

## 3. Predictive Analytics
### **Question it answers:**  
👉 *“What is likely to happen?”*

### **Meaning:**  
Predictive analytics uses **machine learning and statistical models** to forecast future outcomes based on historical data.

### **Examples:**  
- Predicting whether a customer will churn  
- Forecasting next month’s revenue  
- Predicting stock market trends  
- Predicting traffic congestion  

### **Interview phrasing:**  
“It uses ML models to predict future events using patterns in past data.”

---

## 4. Prescriptive Analytics
### **Question it answers:**  
👉 *“What should we do next?”*

### **Meaning:**  
Prescriptive analytics suggests **optimal actions or decisions**.  
It uses simulations, optimization algorithms, and sometimes reinforcement learning.

### **Examples:**  
- Recommending the best pricing strategy  
- Suggesting the most efficient route for delivery trucks  
- Optimizing inventory levels to avoid stockouts  
- Recommending personalized content on Netflix  

### **Interview phrasing:**  
“It recommends actions by evaluating different possible outcomes.”
