## Technical Round Introduction

**Good morning sir. My name is Purvesh Jambhulkar, and I’m currently pursuing my B.E. in Information Technology from D.Y. Patil College of Engineering, Akurdi.**

I’ve built a strong foundation in programming, databases, and big data fundamentals through my academics and the projects I’ve worked on. I have developed several full-stack applications using React, Spring Boot, and MySQL, such as **LearnPlay**, a gamified learning platform, and **Quill.AI**, a text-summarization platform built using LLMs. I’ve also worked on projects like **ZAPI-UI**, a React component library, and a few college event websites.

Working on these projects helped me understand how APIs work, **how databases work in real-world applications**, and how data flows between the frontend, backend, and database. I also practice problem-solving on LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks, which has strengthened my logic-building and DSA fundamentals.

I’m interested in **Infocepts** because the role focuses on analysis, problem-solving, and continuous learning, which aligns well with my strengths. I’m looking forward to applying my technical foundation, learning new technologies, and contributing to meaningful, data-driven projects.

## HR Round Introduction

**Good morning sir. My name is Purvesh Jambhulkar, and I’m currently pursuing my B.E. in Information Technology from D.Y. Patil College of Engineering, Akurdi.**

I’ve built a strong foundation in programming, databases, and big data fundamentals through my academics and the projects I’ve worked on. I also practice problem-solving on LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks, which has strengthened my logic-building and DSA fundamentals.

Along with academics, I have been actively involved in teamwork-oriented activities. As a member of the **ITESA club**, I helped organize technical workshops and events, which taught me coordination, planning, and working with diverse teams. I have also participated in **hackathons**, including the Smart India Hackathon, where collaborating under time constraints improved my communication, adaptability, and problem-solving skills.

I would describe myself as someone who enjoys learning new things, understands responsibilities well, and stays consistent with whatever I start. I like exploring how systems work end-to-end and finding simple, efficient solutions to problems.

I’m interested in **Infocepts** because the role focuses on analysis, problem-solving, and continuous learning, which aligns well with my strengths. I’m looking forward to applying my technical foundation, learning new technologies, and contributing to meaningful, data-driven projects.
