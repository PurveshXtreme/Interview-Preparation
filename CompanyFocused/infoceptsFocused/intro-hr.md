**Good morning sir. My name is Purvesh Jambhulkar, and I’m currently pursuing my B.E. in Information Technology from D.Y. Patil College of Engineering, Akurdi.**

I’ve built a strong foundation in programming, databases, and big data fundamentals through my academics and the projects I’ve worked on. I have developed several full-stack applications using React, Spring Boot, and MySQL, such as **LearnPlay**, a gamified learning platform, and **Quill.AI**, a text-summarization platform built using LLMs. I’ve also worked on projects like **ZAPI-UI**, a React component library, and a few college event websites.

Working on these projects helped me understand how APIs work, **how databases work in real-world applications**, and how data flows between the frontend, backend, and database. I also practice problem-solving on LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks, which has strengthened my logic-building and DSA fundamentals.

I’m interested in **Infocepts** because the role focuses on analysis, problem-solving, and continuous learning, which aligns well with my strengths. I’m looking forward to applying my technical foundation, learning new technologies, and contributing to meaningful, data-driven projects.
