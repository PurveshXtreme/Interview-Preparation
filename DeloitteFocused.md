## Projects

### 1. Quill.AI - Text Summarization Platform

"Quill.AI is a simple text-summarization platform that takes long text as input and generates a concise summary. The main idea of the project was to allow users to quickly understand long articles or documents by using an AI model to shorten the content.

The tech stack includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Python with the Hugging Face BART model for the backend.

My contribution in this project was mainly on the frontend side. I designed the user interface, including the landing page and login forms, and focused on making the UI simple, clean, and easy to use.

From this project, I learned how the frontend communicates with a backend that uses AI models, and how to structure a clean UI that sends user input to an API and displays the summarized output."

### 2. Zync - Chat and Social Feed Platform

"Zync is a simple chat and social feed platform where users can post updates and view messages in a clean interface. The aim of the project was to create a basic communication system with a structured backend and an organized frontend.

The tech stack includes Spring Boot for the backend and React with Redux for the frontend. Spring Boot handles APIs for users, posts, and chat-related data, and React manages the UI. Redux is used to keep the state consistent across the application, especially for things like posts, user data, and chat messages.

My contribution in this project was mainly on the backend and frontend integration. On the backend, I worked with Spring Boot to build REST APIs for users, posts, and chat data. On the frontend, I used React along with Redux to handle state management and display data smoothly.

From this project, I learned how to design clean REST APIs, connect them with a React frontend, and use Redux to manage shared state. It also helped me understand how data flows in a social platform and how to structure both backend and frontend for smooth interaction."

### What is your weakness?

⭐ **Answer:**

"One area I'm working on is my tendency to take on too many tasks at once. I realized that this can reduce efficiency at times. To improve this, I've started prioritizing tasks based on urgency and importance, and I break work into smaller steps. This helps me stay productive."

### Tell me something which is not in your resume

**Answer:**
