## 🧩 C++ Coding Questions

### 🧮 1. Reverse a String
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

    cin >> s;
    reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
    cout << s;
}
```
**Extras:**

---

### 🔤 2. Count Vowels, Consonants, and Spaces
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    string s;
    getline(cin, s);
    int v = 0, c = 0, sp = 0;
    for (char ch : s) {
        if (isspace(ch)) sp++;
        else if (isalpha(ch)) {
            ch = tolower(ch);
            if (ch=='a'||ch=='e'||ch=='i'||ch=='o'||ch=='u') v++;
            else c++;
        }
    }
    cout << "Vowels:" << v << " Consonants:" << c << " Spaces:" << sp;
}
```
**Extras:**
- Remove vowels from a given string.  
- Replace a substring within a string.  
- Remove duplicate characters while maintaining order.  

---

### 🔢 3. Find the Second Largest Element
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {3, 5, 2, 8, 7};
    int first = INT_MIN, second = INT_MIN;
    for (int n : arr) {
        if (n > first) { second = first; first = n; }
        else if (n > second && n < first) second = n;
    }
    cout << "Second largest: " << second;
}
```
**Extras:**
- Find 3rd highest using sorting or heap.  
- Print elements greater than average.

---

### 🔁 4. Fibonacci Sequence
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int n = 10, a = 0, b = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cout << a << " ";
        int next = a + b;
        a = b; b = next;
    }
}
```
**Extras:**
- Check if a number is part of Fibonacci sequence.
- Sum of even Fibonacci numbers up to N.

---

### ✨ 5. Magic Number
> A number is “magic” if the repeated sum of its digits equals 1.  
> Example: 19 → 1+9=10 → 1+0=1 → Magic Number ✅

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int n = 19;
    while (n >= 10) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (n > 0) { sum += n % 10; n /= 10; }
        n = sum;
    }
    cout << (n == 1 ? "Magic Number" : "Not Magic");
}
```

**Extras:**
- Armstrong number  
- Palindrome number  
- Sum of digits using recursion

---

### 🧮 6. Count Even and Odd Elements
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {1,2,3,4,5};
    int even=0, odd=0;
    for(int x : arr) (x%2==0)?even++:odd++;
    cout << "Even: " << even << " Odd: " << odd;
}
```
**Extras:**
- Find Prime numbers up to N.  
- Print numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.

## 💡 Core CS Theory Questions

---

### 🔷 OOPs Concepts

| Concept | Explanation | Example/Extra Question |
|----------|--------------|-----------------------|
| **Encapsulation** | Binding data and methods together; controlling access using access specifiers. | What are public, private, and protected in C++? |
| **Inheritance** | Acquiring properties from a parent class. | Types: Single, Multiple, Multilevel, Hierarchical, Hybrid |
| **Polymorphism** | Ability of one interface to behave differently. | Difference between overloading and overriding |
| **Abstraction** | Hiding unnecessary details and showing only functionality. | Abstract class vs Interface |
| **Constructor/Destructor** | Special methods for initialization and cleanup. | Can destructor be overloaded? (No) |
| **Static Keyword** | Retains value across function calls; class-level variable. | Difference between static and const |

**Extra Questions:**
- Explain runtime vs compile-time polymorphism.  
- Difference between structure and class.  
- What is `this` pointer?  
- Can constructors be virtual? (No)  

---

### 🗄️ DBMS

| Topic | Key Points |
|-------|-------------|
| **BCNF (Boyce Codd Normal Form)** | Stronger form of 3NF; every functional dependency A→B must have A as a superkey. |
| **Foreign Key** | References the primary key of another table to maintain referential integrity. |
| **Why DBMS?** | Manages and organizes data efficiently; ensures integrity and security. |
| **2-Tier vs 3-Tier Architecture** | 2-Tier = Client + DB Server; 3-Tier = Presentation + Logic + Data layers. |

**Extra Questions:**
- Difference between DELETE, TRUNCATE, DROP  
- What is a primary key?  
- What is normalization and its types?  
- Example of SQL query using GROUP BY, HAVING, WHERE  

---

### 🧠 Operating System

| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Process vs Thread** | Process = independent program; Thread = lightweight subprocess within a process. |
| **Thrashing** | When CPU spends more time swapping pages than executing. |
| **Deadlock** | Two or more processes waiting indefinitely for resources. |
| **FIFO** | First-In-First-Out data handling; queue-based scheduling. |

**Extra Questions:**
- What are different types of operating systems?  
- Explain context switching.  
- What is a semaphore?  

---

### 💻 Software Concepts

| Concept | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
| **Overloading vs Overriding** | Overloading: Same function name, different params (compile-time). Overriding: Redefining parent function (runtime). |
| **Java not fully OOP** | Because of primitive data types. |
| **Access Specifiers** | Public, Private, Protected define access control in classes. |
