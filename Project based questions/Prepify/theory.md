## 🗣️ How to Explain the "Prepify" Project in an Interview

### ✅ Sample Answer:

Sure! One of the projects I’ve worked on recently is called **Prepify**, an AI-powered mock interview platform designed to help candidates practice job interviews more effectively.

The idea came from the challenge most people face when preparing for interviews — it's hard to get personalized, realistic mock interview practice, especially with useful feedback. Prepify solves this by using **Gemini AI** to generate **custom interview questions** based on the selected job role.

Once the interview starts, users can **record their answers using video and audio**, thanks to **MediaRecorder APIs**. These responses are then **transcribed to text**, and we use AI to **analyze and rate** the responses on both **technical and soft skills**.

At the end of the session, the user receives **detailed feedback**, along with **model answers** for comparison, helping them understand where they can improve. We also track their **progress over time**, but importantly, we ensure **complete privacy** — video and audio data is processed but **not stored**.

From a tech perspective, the frontend is built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, giving us a fast and responsive UI. For authentication, we used **Clerk**, and the backend uses **Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL**. The app is deployed on **Vercel**, and all the AI logic is handled by **Gemini APIs**.

The project supports **secure login**, a dashboard to **view or add interviews**, and a complete **workflow from question generation to feedback**. It’s live at:

# 💬 Project-Based Interview Questions – Prepify (AI Powered Mock Interview Platform)

---

## 1. **What was your role in this project?**

**Sample Answer:**

> I built the project end-to-end. I handled the **frontend using Next.js and Tailwind CSS**, set up **authentication with Clerk**, and implemented the **backend with Drizzle ORM and PostgreSQL**. I also worked on integrating **Gemini AI** for generating questions and feedback. Additionally, I used the **MediaRecorder API** to enable realistic video/audio recording and ensured smooth user flow across the interview journey.

---

## 2. **How does Prepify generate questions and model answers?**

**Sample Answer:**

> Prepify uses the **Gemini AI API** to generate **5 personalized questions** based on the job role selected by the user. Along with each question, Gemini also returns a **model answer**, which is shown after the interview for comparison. This helps users understand ideal responses and improve over time.

---

## 3. **How does the feedback mechanism work?**

**Sample Answer:**

> Once the interview is completed, each spoken answer is **transcribed to text** using the browser’s Web Speech API. This transcript is then analyzed by **Gemini AI**, which gives **structured feedback** across parameters like clarity, content, confidence, and communication. The user gets an easy-to-read **scorecard and comments** to help improve their performance.

---

## 4. **How did you handle media privacy and security?**

**Sample Answer:**

> Privacy was a priority. We used the **MediaRecorder API** only for local processing — none of the video or audio is uploaded or stored. All media is handled **in-memory**, and only the **transcribed text** is sent for evaluation, ensuring users can practice in a private and secure space.

---

## 5. **What challenges did you face during development?**

**Sample Answer:**

> One challenge was ensuring consistent **audio/video recording across browsers**. I had to handle fallbacks and permissions carefully. Another issue was the **latency of AI responses**, so I added loading states and made the experience more predictable. Also, setting up **role-based flows in Clerk** required a bit of customization.

---

## 6. **Why did you use Clerk for authentication instead of Firebase/Auth0?**

**Sample Answer:**

> I chose **Clerk** because it offers a plug-and-play solution with beautiful, pre-built UIs for login, signup, and user profile. It integrates very well with **Next.js**, and session management is seamless. Compared to Firebase or Auth0, Clerk saved a lot of dev time and handled edge cases cleanly.

---

## 7. **Explain the tech stack decision. Why Next.js, Drizzle, Tailwind, etc.?**

**Sample Answer:**

> **Next.js** was ideal for performance, SSR, and routing. **Tailwind CSS** made styling fast and consistent. For database, I chose **PostgreSQL** and used **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe and clean database queries. **Vercel** was used for deployment as it works best with Next.js out of the box.

---

## 8. **How do you track user progress?**

**Sample Answer:**

> After each interview session, I store a **report in PostgreSQL** which includes the questions asked, user answers, AI feedback, and scores. Users can access their **history and track improvements** over time. This persistent data helps in continuous self-assessment.

---

## 9. **How does the system ensure accurate transcription of responses?**

**Sample Answer:**

> The system uses the **Web Speech API** to convert audio to text in real-time. We guide users to use headphones and speak clearly to improve accuracy. The transcript is cleaned before being sent to Gemini for evaluation, ensuring reliable analysis.

---

## 10. **How is the user experience optimized for different devices?**

**Sample Answer:**

> The UI is built using **Tailwind’s responsive utility classes**, ensuring it adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts. I also adjusted how media recording elements behave based on screen size to ensure a smooth and intuitive experience for all users.
