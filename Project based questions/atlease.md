# AtLease – Decentralized Warehouse Leasing Platform

**AtLease** is a decentralized platform designed to simplify and secure the process of leasing warehouses using **blockchain technology**. It combines **React** for the frontend, **Spring Boot** for authentication and backend operations, and **Python** for handling blockchain logic and smart contract functionalities.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java 17)  
- **Blockchain:** Python  
- **Authentication:** OAuth 2.0 (Google Login)  
- **Database:** MySQL  

## 🚧 Project Status
Currently **in progress** — the backend models and authentication features have been implemented. The project is in the integration phase, where blockchain and backend services are being connected.

## 💡 My Contribution
I worked on the **Spring Boot backend**, where I:
- Implemented **OAuth 2.0 authentication** using **Google Login**.  
- Designed **data models** for users, including renters and warehouse owners.  
- Built **CRUD operations** for managing user and warehouse data.  

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Learned to integrate **OAuth 2.0 authentication** in Spring Boot.  
- Strengthened understanding of **backend design** and **data modeling**.  
- Gained exposure to **blockchain integration** concepts in full-stack applications.
