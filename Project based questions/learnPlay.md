**LearnPlay** is an **educational platform** that makes learning **engaging and fun** by turning topics into **interactive quizzes and games**.  
It was built using **React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS** for the **frontend** and **Spring Boot with Java 17** for the **backend**.  
For authentication and APIs, we implemented **JWT authentication** and **RESTful endpoints**.  

The **workflow** is straightforward:  

- The **user** interacts with the **frontend**, playing quizzes and tracking progress.  
- The **frontend** communicates with the **backend** through **REST APIs**.  
- The **backend** manages **user accounts**, **progress tracking**, and **content transformation into quizzes**, and sends the processed data back to the **frontend**.  

I contributed to the **backend development**, where I worked with **Spring Boot** and **JWT authentication**.  
My focus was on creating a **secure** and **scalable backend** so that users could reliably log in, track progress, and access quizzes seamlessly.

❓ **Why did you choose these technologies (React, Spring Boot, JWT, etc.)?**  
✅ *Answer:*  
“We used **React** because it makes building interactive and responsive UIs easier. **Spring Boot** was chosen for the backend since it provides a strong framework for building REST APIs and handling business logic. We used **JWT authentication** to make login and session handling secure and reliable.”

❓ **What challenges did you face while working on this project? How did you overcome those challenges?**  
✅ *Answer:*  
“One challenge I faced was implementing **JWT authentication** correctly. At first, managing tokens and securing API endpoints was tricky. I solved this by breaking the problem into steps — first understanding how JWT works, then implementing token generation, and finally securing the endpoints. Testing each part separately helped me overcome the issue.”

❓ **What did you learn from working on this project?**  
✅ *Answer:*  
“I learned how to build and secure a **backend with Spring Boot**, and how authentication works in real applications. It also gave me experience in integrating a backend with a React frontend through REST APIs. Most importantly, I understood the importance of writing clean, modular code so the project can be scaled easily.”
