**LearnPlay** is an **educational platform** that makes learning **engaging and fun** by turning topics into **interactive quizzes and games**.  
It was built using **React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS** for the **frontend** and **Spring Boot with Java 17** for the **backend**.  
For authentication and APIs, we implemented **JWT authentication** and **RESTful endpoints**.  

The **workflow** is straightforward:  

- The **user** interacts with the **frontend**, playing quizzes and tracking progress.  
- The **frontend** communicates with the **backend** through **REST APIs**.  
- The **backend** manages **user accounts**, **progress tracking**, and **content transformation into quizzes**, and sends the processed data back to the **frontend**.  

I contributed to the **backend development**, where I worked with **Spring Boot** and **JWT authentication**.  
My focus was on creating a **secure** and **scalable backend** so that users could reliably log in, track progress, and access quizzes seamlessly.
