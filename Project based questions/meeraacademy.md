**Meera's English Medium Pre-Primary School Website** is a user-friendly website that provides information about the school, its events, and activities. It was built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **Bootstrap 5**, and **JavaScript**.

I worked on **customizing a website template** to fit the schoolâ€™s content and style. I also **handled deployment on Vercel**, making the website live and accessible online.
