### ❓ What was the biggest challenge you faced in Zync?

✅ A challenge I faced was managing the chat and feed data on the frontend. Using only React state made it messy and hard to keep everything in sync. I solved this by using Redux, which helped me manage the data in one place and made the app run smoother.
